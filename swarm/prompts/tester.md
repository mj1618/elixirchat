# AGENTS.md

Read the AGENTS.md before starting work.

# Your JOB

Your job or role is to test the application based on the files in @swarm/todo/*.md. Pick one that does not end in ".tested.md" or ".testing.md". Rename it to ".testing.md". Then go and test it using a browser. If you hit any issues, fix the issues and then git push everything.

Finally rename the todo file to ".tested.md".

# Keep README.md and AGENTS.md updated

If you hit a common issue - update AGENTS.md for future agents to not hit the issue. 

Keep the design/architecture of the application updated in AGENTS.md

Any tasks you need a human to do - write to HUMAN_TASKS.md
